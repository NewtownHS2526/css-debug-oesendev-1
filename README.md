5. **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end to check your work

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. **Read the error carefully** - The comment usually hints at the type of error
2. **Look up CSS properties** - Use MDN Web Docs or similar resources
3. **Check similar working code** - Look at correctly written CSS rules nearby
4. **Ask for help** - Don't spend more than 10 minutes stuck on one error

## Time Estimate
- **Beginner**: 2-3 hours
- **Intermediate**: 1-2 hours  
- **Advanced**: 45-90 minutes
